This is an interactive web interface for Debian's BTS.

It uses Django as the server-side framework, and MochiKit as the javascript
client side helper.

In order to run this, you need to have python and django installed. It works ok
with django-1.0

INSTALLATION AND SETUP
======================

Packages to install
-------------------

In Debian (lenny, squeeze, sid):
    # apt-get install python python-django python-pysqlite2 python-soappy python-django-registration

First time setup
----------------
To get the necessary databases created you need to run (in the checkout dir):
    $ python manage.py syncdb

Running the server
-----------------
After creating the databases, you can use the "runserver.sh" script to
have a local webserver, that will start running on the 8000 port by
default.
    $ ./runserver.sh

Most operations require a running mail server (MTA). You can use the bundled
dummy server:
    $ ./mailserver.sh

If you want to use your system's MTA you should edit settings.py and look for
EMAIL_HOST AND EMAIL_PORT options:
    (...)
    EMAIL_HOST = 'localhost'
    EMAIL_PORT = '25'
    (...)

Change the script if you need to use a different port.

To set the domain name, you should go to:
    http://0.0.0.0:8000/admin

Using the admin user in the Amancay interface does not currently work.
