This is an interactive web interface for Debian's BTS.

It uses Django as the server-side framework, and MochiKit as the javascript
client side helper.

In order to run this, you need to have python and django installed.  The
Django versions this program was tested against are 0.95 and 0.96.

INSTALLATION AND SETUP
======================

  Packages to install
  -------------------

    apt-get install python python-django python-pysqlite2 python-soappy

  First time setup
  ----------------

  To get the necessary databases created you need to run:

     python manage.py syncdb

  From the main directory (bts_webui)

  Running the server
  -----------------

  After creating the databases, you can use the "runserver.sh" script to
  have a local webserver, that will start running on the 8000 port by
  default.  Change the script if you need to use a different port.
